Uninstalling Hexo: A Step-by-Step Guide
If you have been using Hexo as your blogging platform and have decided to switch to another alternative or simply no longer need it, you may want to uninstall it from your system. Uninstalling Hexo is a straightforward process, and this article will guide you through the steps.
Step 1: Backup your Hexo files
Before proceeding with the uninstallation, it is recommended to create a backup of your Hexo files. This backup will ensure that you do not lose any important data or configurations associated with your blog.
To create a backup, locate your Hexo folder on your system. Typically, this folder is named after your blog and is located in the directory where you installed Hexo. Once you have found the folder, copy it to a safe location such as an external hard drive or cloud storage.
Step 2: Remove Hexo dependencies
Hexo is built on Node.js, so it relies on several dependencies. To uninstall Hexo, you will need to remove these dependencies as well.
Open your command line interface (CLI) and navigate to your Hexo blog directory. From there, run the following command to remove Hexo dependencies:
npm uninstall hexo
This command will uninstall Hexo and its associated dependencies from your system.


Step 3: Remove Hexo from your global packages
If you have installed Hexo as a global package, you will need to remove it as well. To do this, run the following command in your CLI:
npm uninstall -g hexo-cli
This command will remove the Hexo command-line interface (CLI) from your global packages.

Step 4: Delete Hexo files
Now that you have uninstalled Hexo and its dependencies, it is time to delete the Hexo files from your system.
Locate the Hexo folder on your system and delete it. Be cautious when deleting files, as this action is irreversible. Double-check that you have created a backup of your Hexo files before proceeding.
Step 5: Clear Hexo cache and configurations
To ensure a clean uninstallation, you should delete any remaining Hexo cache and configurations. These files might be located in different directories depending on your system and how you have set up Hexo.
Search for any Hexo-related files or folders on your system and delete them. These files might include cache folders, configuration files, or any other remnants of the Hexo installation.
Conclusion
Uninstalling Hexo from your system is a simple process if you follow these steps. Remember to create a backup of your Hexo files before proceeding, and double-check any deletions to ensure you do not accidentally delete any important data. If you ever decide to use Hexo again in the future, you can always reinstall it following the installation instructions provided by the Hexo documentation.
